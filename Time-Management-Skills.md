## Time management skills and best practices to learn

Time management is an important component of your overall productivity in your career and life. 
Knowing how to manage your time at work or through an educational program like Microverse can reduce stress and improve your ability to function effectively. 
Time management skills and best practices include various skills and tips that will help you manage your time well. 
Some of the most important time management skills and best practices include: 

- **Planning**: A fundamental time management skill is planning. Planning means broadly looking at the workload you have to get through and effectively laying it out in smaller parts.
- **SMART goal-setting**: A great way to manage your time effectively is to set SMART(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Result-focused, Timely) goals. Setting SMART goals allows you to determine what tasks need to be prioritized and makes sure your tasks are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This process increases your chances for success in a project.
- **Staying organized**: Maintaining a clear picture of what you need to complete and when is an effective organization skill. Being well-organized might mean maintaining an up-to-date calendar, locating certain documents easily, having a tidy environment, and taking detailed, diligent notes.
- **Communicating**: Developing strong communication skills can allow you to make your plans and goals clear to people you work with. It also allows you to ask for help, which is important in a remote study and working environment. During your time at Microverse, we shall talk about communication a lot to help you develop these skills that are key to success in a remote professional environment.
- **Managing stress**: Staying attentive to your mental health is a relevant time management best practice. Positively handling stress can help you stay motivated and perform well in your daily activities. You might do this by including small breaks throughout your day, recognizing and communicating personal problems that are out of your control, or rewarding yourself in small ways as you accomplish tasks.

## Communicating delays or absenteeism effectively

The above time management skills are to be practiced regularly to improve and achieve your goals. 
However, there are days when you might not be able to complete a task due to a personal situation outside of your control or a reasonable professional situation! 

The above time management skills are to be practiced regularly to improve and achieve your goals. However, there are days when you might not be able to complete a task due to a personal situation outside of your control or a reasonable professional situation! Maybe the task is larger than you estimated or you ran into a technical issue you're struggling to solve. On days like these, communicating effectively with your coding partners, colleagues, manager, or anyone else monitoring or involved in the project is important.

Here are some practical ways to recognise and communicate delays:

Recognize and acknowledge that a situation is beyond your control or the task is beyond your capacity. An example could be an electricity/power issue or a bad connectivity/internet issue that cannot be resolved within a significant time-frame without impacting your schedule. It could also be a health-related issue or a family emergency. Whatever the situation may be, ensure to have an awareness of it.
Estimate how long the delay could last and proactively consider the impact of the delay. An example would be estimating that a nation-wide internet disruption would last for 24 hours, and proactively checking if you would miss your deadline with a 24 hour delay.
Be honest and transparent, and continue to make communication a top priority. Use the given or recommended communication tools to update and stay in touch with relevant parties, including your coding partner and the Student Success team. Asynchronous communication will be helpful in cases like this. See below for links on the difference between synchronous and asynchronous remote work.
