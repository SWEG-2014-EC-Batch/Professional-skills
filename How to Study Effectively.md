## (1) Daily Habits
The first thing you must do is understand how you utilize your time, so we start by looking at how you spend an average day.

##### Time Pyramid
How do you spend your day? For the most part, we divide our time every day between a few common activities that we all do on a daily basis: sleep, work/study, socialize with family and friends, and “others” which includes hobbies, exercise, watching TV, etc.

##### Learning Activities
Write down the number of hours you spend on average for each of the 4 main areas: Sleeping, Work/Study, Social Activities, Others. The time pyramid is ideally how you should divide your time. Notice there is a range for each activity, so being within that range gives you sufficient time to manage your daily activities.
