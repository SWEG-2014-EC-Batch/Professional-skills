## How to Study Effectively
As the saying goes, ‘knowledge is power’.  Getting success in your course and your academic career at the highest level will depend largely on your ability 
to study effectively. To prepare for the challenges of tomorrow, you must equip yourselves with the right kind of knowledge, skills, and attitudes starting today. 

### How? 
Learning and studying more effectively means building better, more efficient learning and study habits. 
Study skills are vital for academic success, but many of us have never developed the skills appropriate for the workload and rigor necessary for success. 
However, with a few changes to your behavior and some tried and tested psychological tricks and study techniques, preparing can be a lot easier than 
you might have expected. Successful students/learners must set themselves up for success before, during, and after any class through proper preparation,
effective note-taking, and utilizing the right techniques in order to achieve the success they aspire to. Here are some useful tools and strategies you can follow and 
apply in order to learn the knowledge you need in order to prepare yourself for a successful future.

## (1) Manage Your Daily Habits
The first thing you must do is understand how you utilize your time, so we start by looking at how you spend an average day.

##### Time Pyramid

How do you spend your day? For the most part, we divide our time every day between a few common activities that we all do on a daily basis: sleep, work/study, socialize with family and friends, and “others” which includes hobbies, exercise, watching TV, etc. 


##### Learning Activities
Write down the number of hours you spend on average for each of the 4 main areas: Sleeping, Work/Study, Social Activities, Others. The time pyramid is ideally how you should divide your time. Notice there is a range for each activity, so being within that range gives you sufficient time to manage your daily activities.

## (2) Manage your time

It's important to manage your time efficiently so that you can guard against procrastination. By managing your time, you will be able to allot the appropriate amount of time and effort to your various priorities. Thus, prepare a weekly and(or) daily schedule in which you:
- Prioritize your assignments
- Create blocks of study time
- Schedule activities for after your school work
- Arrange a study group or partner with a study mate
- Plan to spend at least two hours of study time for every hour of class
- Use Technology: Scheduling Effectively like Quizlet, Cram.com, Evernote and others

## (3) Apply Time Management Principles and Toolbox
When trying to decide whether an activity or task is aligned with your priorities, it is helpful to ask yourself what is important and what is not. This time matrix was popularized by Dr. Stephen R. Covey and will help you answer those questions daily.

The matrix is divided into 4 quadrants as illustrated in the below diagram. As you learn to differentiate between what is urgent versus what is important, you will find that you are more effective in allocating time to those tasks that help you achieve your priorities.

Reflection Questions:
* Which quadrant had the most tasks? 
* Which quadrant had the fewest tasks?

### Good To Know:
People who are most successful at achieving their priorities spend the majority of their time in Quadrants 1 and 2. People who are often unsuccessful in reaching their goals are usually distracted by Quadrant 3 or spend too much time in Quadrant 4.


## (4) Study Before and After Class
 ### (a) Arrange Your Study Space

 ### (b) Practice Active Study Techniques
Many popular study techniques - highlighting, re-reading - are actually passive study techniques, meaning they do not require high engagement with the content. Because of this, they are not necessarily the best ways to understand and retain new information. Active study techniques, on the other hand, force you to interact and engage with the text in deeper ways, therefore helping you to process the information more thoroughly. 

##### Use the Feynman Technique to review concepts
This five-step technique relies on the old saying “while we teach, we learn,” which essentially means that the best way to learn a concept, is to explain it to someone else

Note taking forces you to think critically and carefully about the information that is being presented. It also helps you in terms of understanding the information and remembering it. While there is no single “best” way to take notes, keep the following suggestions in mind: 
- Keep your notes brief. Use abbreviations, symbols and words or phrases rather than a full sentence whenever possible.
- Other than formulas, definitions or specific facts, keep the notes in your own words. 
- Include all main ideas and enough important points to develop an understanding. 
- Don’t take time to outline during the lecture, but differentiate between major and minor points. 
- Use the margins for questions and comments to yourself.

### (c) Participate in Discussions

 - Participating will help bolster your marks in a class.
 - Many classes will grade on participation, whether it’s stated in the syllabus or not, so participating can help bolster your mark.
 - This will help you stand out to your professors, which will help later on when you’re looking for someone to write a letter of recommendation.
 - Participating will help you clarify content or ideas you may not quite understand.
 - It is likely that many people in the class may have the same or a similar question to you, or may bring up points to help you think of things in new ways
 - Participating will help you from becoming bored or distracted in the class.
 - Research has shown that engaging with the same material in different ways - reading, speaking, writing, and listening - increases your retention and understanding, so participating is another way for you to retain and process information from your class.
