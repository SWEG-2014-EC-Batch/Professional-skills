# Mind Set and Grit

A **mindset** is a series of **self-perceptions or beliefs** people hold about themselves. These _determine behaviour, outlook and mental attitude_. 
For example, believing you are either** _'intelligent'_ **or **_'unintelligent'_**.

**Grit** refers to a student's ability to persist after setbacks. Grit is related to mindset in that if one believes that failures are due to their fixed traits, 
there is no reason to try again. Conversely, individuals with growth mindset are more likely to be resilient and have more grit.
