## Learning objectives

- Use Google to find solutions to technical issues that arise during learning.

- Use HTML documentation.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

Learning how to be a web developer means learning many new concepts, technologies, tools, etc. Many times you will find yourself stuck and without any clue what to do next.
However, the good news is that you are probably not the first person to have encountered that specific problem, and we have the internet to help us share our knowledge, difficulties we faced, and possible solutions.
So, the knowledge is out there, and the best skill you can develop is making sure you are not afraid to use it.

### Why is it important?

Being a web developer is the type of job that requires constant learning. Looking for solutions, asking questions, and discussing different options will be a part of your daily life.
It is impossible to learn everything you need to know to become a web developer and then stop learning anything new, because there is so much information out there and so much of it changes frequently that it requires web developers to constantly learn new things to keep up with new standards and ways of doing things. 
Since it is impossible to learn everything about web development because it is such a broad, quickly changing field that means that you will often be using external resources to answer your questions and learn new things not only during the entire Microverse program but also in your future job.
Even though it is quite typical for web developers to look up information sometimes, many beginners feel like it is a shame not to have all of that information memorized.
If that is how you feel, then the sooner you stop feeling that way, the sooner you will be able to begin practicing how to research things online.

### How to look for answers online

- Let's start with the fundamental tool that you are more probably already familiar with: Google. Read why Google is your best friend in the article [Google: A Developers Best Friend](https://medium.com/@MouseRat/google-a-developers-best-friend-261d4f02e903).
- Then, learn why [Stack Overflow = Programmers' Best Friend](https://codeburst.io/stack-overflow-programmers-best-friend-ef77e4d142c4).
- Since you might be wondering ["Do experienced programmers use Google frequently?"](https://codeahoy.com/2016/04/30/do-experienced-programmers-use-google-frequently/), read this article to find out the answer!

#### Technical documentation

And last but not least: documentation deserves a special mention.
Whatever technology you use, it should be documented online (and remember, you can find it using Google - your best friend!). 
Documentation can be scary at when you first look at it because it gives you a lot of technical details without giving you direct answers to your questions. 
However, as soon as you get familiar with the documentation, you will be able to search it to find the answer to your specific question.
As a starting point, check:
- [Mozilla's documentation of the `<a>` HTML tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and browse the documentation for other tags.
- [Mozilla's documentation of the CSS property `color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) and browse the documentation for other properties.

## Challenge yourself
*Use these questions to check what you learned during this lesson.* 

- Using CSS documentation, can you figure out how to make the border of a square-shaped element turn into a dotted line for the top and bottom borders and turn into a dashed line for the left and right borders?
- Using HTML documentation, can you figure out how to make the elements of an ordered list numbered using Roman numerals?
- Are you able you figure out how to place an image exactly in the center of the screen?

# How to ask questions on online forums

## Learning objectives
- Learn how to structure questions on online forums to get your questions answered well.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description
You have already learned how to research online resources to find answers to your questions. But what do you do if the problem that you have is very specific and has never happened to anyone else?
Even if you find a piece of existing advice somewhere on the internet for most questions you need to research, a situation like that will eventually happen to you.
Therefore you should be prepared to ask your question in a clear, detailed way that is the most likely to get you the answers you are looking for.

### Why is it important?

First, the more clearly you ask your questions, the better the chances that you will get a quick and useful response.
Second, the well-described issue can help other people who might need to solve a problem similar to yours in the future.

### What does it mean to ask questions well?

- Remember to **always** provide **the context** of your question.
- Read some techniques for how to write your questions in this article [How to ask programming questions](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/how-to-ask-programming-questions).
- Check Stack Overflow's article [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

## Challenge yourself
*Use these optional questions to check what you learned during this lesson.* 

- Reflect on programming questions you have asked in the past:
    - Did you always provide all the necessary info, or did people need to ask you many additional questions to understand your problem?
    - Did you do proper research before asking your question?
    - Did you document the solution once you found it to make other people's lives easier?
